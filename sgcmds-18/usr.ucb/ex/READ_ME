What you have here is a hacked up version of the 4.3BSD vi with suitable
mods to make it work on SUNOS (a hacked-up 4.2BSD kernel).  Notable
additions to this version are:

	:W -- a command which unlinks a file before writing it
		handy for the break_link function of the SGS tools
	:pf -- print the file stack - this version stacks files whenever
		you tag or :e to another file; :pf shows the stack
	:e^ -- pop the file stack and edit that file
	:pp -- pop the file stack, but continue to edit the current file

Note that the 4.3BSD version of vi is somewhat more careful about
sourceing .exrc files (it won't source them unless you own them,
"set sourceany" to get the old insecure behavior of 4.2BSD vi.

Also note that the vi "modeline" stuff must be explicitly turned
on via "set modeline"

**********************

This is version 3 of the editor. It is too large to fit on a pdp-11
unless you have overlay code. (Such code is available for v7 unix on 2bsd.)

Version 2.13 corresponds to version 3 without the enhancements in 3.
There is no reason to use 2.13 unless you have a pdp-11 that does not have
overlay software, since 3 contains all the bug fixes and some new features.

Special installation notes for this version.
2) The include file varargs.h should be installed, as the printf here needs it.
3) The include file local/uparm.h should be installed, as ex_tune.h needs it.
   The contents of this include file can be modified if you wish to place
   the editor in a nonstandard location.

Conditional compilation flags:
	-DTRACE		for debugging (wont then fit on an 11)
	-DVFORK		for UCB Vax/Unix with the vfork system call.
	-DCHDIR		compile in undocumented old chdir (cd) command
	-DLISP		compile in lisp hacks
	-DUCVISUAL	compile in code to handle \ escapes for visual on
			upper case only terminals.  gross.
	-DCRYPT		-x option to edit encrypted files
