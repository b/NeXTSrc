Release notes for the -23 compiler release (link editor, shlibs and tools)
by Kevin Enderby

Changes related to cc-23:
New major sections:
    GNU Assembler
	The assembler now allows ""'s around symbol names and takes everything
	inside the ""'s as the symbol name.  This feature is what enables the
	compiler to now produce symbol table names of the form
	"+[ClassName(CategoryName) Method:Name:]" for objective-C methods.

    GNU Profiler
	The progiler, gprof(1), now knows about objective-C categories and
	prints method names with the category name if it was in a category.

Addtional notes for the release notes "Link Editor, Shared Libraries,and Tools":
"Major Changes" section:
    The Link Edit Segment Gets Created by Default
	The link edit segment gets created by default for the output formats
	that can have it.  To not create this segment the -noseglinkedit option 
	must be specified.
    A New Tool to Diagnose EBADEXEC Errors
	The program ebadexec(1) takes a program as it's argument and trys to
	determine why it can't be executed.

Addtional notes for the release notes "Link Editor, Shared Libraries,and Tools":
"Minor Changes" section:
    The Default Output Format of ld(1) -A is Now MH_OBJECT
	The default output format of ld(1) -A is now MH_OBJECT and previouly
	was the MH_EXECUTE format.  This was done because the __PAGEZERO
	segment of the output file will typically overlap with the __PAGEZERO
	segment of the base file if both file's formats are the default
	MH_EXECUTE.  There now is a new option, -b, used when using -A to strip
	the base file symbols from the output file which can greatly reduce
	the size for the output.
