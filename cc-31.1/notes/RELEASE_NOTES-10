The 1.0 system release (-10 compiler release) contains the following changes:

   Changes to the Objective-C compiler:

   * The maximum size of an object was extended from 32 kbytes to 
     4,000,000 kbytes.

   * `self' is now statically typed by the Objective-C compiler...this 
     will provide better error diagnostics for sending messages to `self'.

   * the `-objc' switch was renamed to `-ObjC'. This switch tells
     the compiler that it is about to compile a file that contains 
     Objective-C code.

   New features:

   * You can now have multiple classes per source file.

   * `@encode(<typespec>)' will return a type string that identifies 
     <typespec>. This is useful when using methods that take Archiver 
     encoded strings. For example,

     [Storage newCount:0 elementSize:sizeof(Foo) description:@encode(Foo)];
     
     This abstracts users from understanding the format of this string,
     which may change.

   Changes to the Objective-C runtime:

   * the Objective-C error handler now calls `abort()' instead of `exit()'.
     this causes a core file to be produced.

   Changes to `objc.h' (not complete):

   * `id' is now defined here, it was previously atomagically declared by
     the compiler. This makes it easier to include this file standard `.c'
     files.

   * SEL is now defined to be an `unsigned int'.

   * SHR is now `Class'.

   Performance Improvements:

   * the `+initialize' is sent to classes lazily. This implies that no
     messages will be sent before executing main().

   * You can now compile Objective-C code with the `-fomit-frame-pointer'
     option. It is know longer dependent on locating the previous stack frame
     to accomplish sending messages to `super'. 

   Low level changes (will not concern most app writers):

   * The object type string used for archiving has been extended to support
     the following types:

     - bitfields...`b<width>', where <width> is a decimal.
     - pointers...`^<type>, where <type> is a basic or aggregate type.

   * Name Changes:

     	_msg() and _msgSuper()

	have been changed to:

	objc_msgSendSelf() and objc_msgSendSuper()

	If you call _msgSuper() directly (you shouldn't be), your code 
	will have to conform to the new calling conventions. See me if 
	this is an issue.
