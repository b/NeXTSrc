  Release 5: 0.8 final release.  Mostly the same as release 4, with the 
following minor changes:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ld

- Fixed overlapping checking which didn't include bss_size.
- Added overlap checking of all segments except the unix thread stack.
- Cleaned up the error handling routines to take a variable number of arguments.
- Added the -ident option.
- Fixed a bug that didn't get the 2..n sections of segments created from files
  offset right as well as not writing out the section data.  The bottom of the
  second loop in write_seg_create() was missing: slp = slp->next; .

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
otool/atom

- Fixed a bug in otool to print out unknown thread states correctly and not
  just print "\n"'s forever.
- Fixed a bug in atom that didn't handle stripped a.out files and not complain
  about not being able reading the string table.
- Fixed a bug in atom that didn't remove the output file before exiting non-
  zero in error cases.
- Added the printing of LC_IDENT load commands.
- Added support to print out the NeXT_THREAD_STATE_USER_REG flavor of thread
  state.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mkshlib

- Fixed the problem of a symbol that is both a private_externs and the alias
  of an aliased symbol (-aoriginal:alias) which did not get removed from
  objects that referenced them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gprof

- Now knows how correctly list objective-C selectors in the profiling output.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cc

- Fixed an obscure symbol table problem which caused bad symbol table 
  information to be emitted if there was a function declaration followed by
  a forward declaration of the same function.

- Added support for -Ttext and -Tdata in the cc driver.

- Added support for the -lineMax:NNN arg for objective-C in the cc driver.

- Modified the format of the -vt switch in the driver to be less verbose,
  just print the timing info of each pass.  -vvt now is verbose and timing
  info.

- cpp now predefines __MACH__.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gdb

- Several problems dealing with corefiles that contained multiple threads
  were fixed.

- A new thread flavor found in core files is now supported.

- Out of bound memory references are now detected and an error message is 
  printed.  Previously the value zero was always printed.

- An error in the lex routine was fixed which didn't always parse floating
  point constants that start with a decimal point correctly.

- A new command "really-run" was added that does a run without asking for
  verification.

- A bug which caused the vm_cache not to get flushed when a previous error
  had been detected is now fixed.

- GDB now supports a "format" command which does the following:

format
	Prints the current format options.
format maximum-string NNN
	Sets the maximum number of characters printed in a character string
	to the decimal number NNN (by default 200).
format struct-indent N
	If N == 1, structures are indented when printed with a CR/NL after
	every field in the struct.  This is now the default.  If N == 0,
	structure fields are printed contiguously with commas seperating 
	each field.
format union-print N
	if N == 1, all fields of a union are printed when the union is printed.
	if N == 0, only the names of the variants are printed.  The user must
	specify the variants of the union (s)he is interested in to see it
	printed in its entirety.
format maximum-line NNN
	Maximum number of lines to be printed before a "--- hit CR for more --"
	message is printed and a pause for a newline is done.  This should 
	be the number of lines on the screen minus a few (user preference).
	The value 0 is special in that the output never pauses (useful if
	run under shellapp).

- A new verion of gdb (kgdb) now supports kernel debugging.  It works with the
  latest release of the compiler (cc-4 or greater).

- The path /usr/lib/.gdbinit specifies an additional "system wide" .gdbinit
  file.  This changed from /usr/next_cross/usr/lib/.gdbinit.

- A new "really-quit" command was added to quit without asking for 
  confirmation.

- A bug which prevented enums from being printed correctly has been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
libobjc.a (the library):

- methods that return structures > 64 bits now work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
objcc.exe (the compiler):

- the maximum length of a line was raised from 512 to 4096 bytes.
  if this is still not enough, the Objective-C compiler accepts a switch
  named "-lineMax:<n>". This instructs the compiler to use <n> as the maximum 
  length of a line.

- the ellipsis ("...") operator is now passed through when used within a
  function prototype.
