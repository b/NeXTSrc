Addtional notes for the release notes "Link Editor, Shared Libraries,and Tools":
    Change the paragraph "Possible Debugger Problems" to the "Link Editor,
    Shared Libraries, and Tools" "Minor Changes" section to:
	Possible debugger problems
	    The debugger has trouble without the "file.o" local text symbols
	    normally generated by a UNIX a.out style link editor.  To solve this
	    problem the compiler now generates a new SO stab at the end of the
	    text of the module.  This requires all programs linked with the new
	    link editor to be recompiled if they are to be debugged.  The
	    debugger generates a warning about this when it sees this condition.
	    For now any non-NeXT compiler, namely Fortran, will not be debugable
	    unless it is lined with the "-segobjectsymbols __TEXT __text"
	    option.  Also the debugger may have trouble with the fact that
	    common symbols are now allocated in the (__DATA,__common) section
	    instead of the (__DATA,__bss) section (which will cause the section
	    numbers no longer to be constant as in the 1.0 release).
