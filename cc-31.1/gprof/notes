Changes for the Warp ?? release (the -24 compiler release):
- Fixed a bug when the text symbol for the highest value was looked up it would
  print the message "binary lookup failed" then it returned NULL and later gprof
  would core dump.  Their were two problems the first was in the function
  getsymtab() in gprof.c in the Mach-O case the last entry in the nl[] array
  did not have it's value set to -1.  The other problem was that in the function
  nllookup() in lookup.c was searching to index "nname - 1" and not to nname
  which would have picked up the last nl[] entry with the -1 in it.
- Changed DFN_DEPTH from 100 to 1000 as per bug report #4851.

Changes for the 2.0 impulse X.X release (the -23 compiler release):
- Changed the installed mode to not be writeable (755 to 555 and 644 to 444).
- Now is linked with libsys.

Changes for the 2.0 impulse X.X release (the -19 compiler release):
- Fixed the modified mlist function that includes printing categories which
  did not allocate enough space.

Changes for the 2.0 impulse X.X release (the -19 compiler release):
- Put in the modified mlist function that includes printing categories.

Changes for the 0.91 release (the -12 compiler release):
- Added MH_PRELOAD to the types of files gprof will take.
- Updated the printing of method names for for the new objective-C runtime.
- Ifdef'ed off code in mach_o.c that delt with shared libraries.  It was
  calling itself, read_mach_o(), totally wrong.  This code could have never
  worked and since all the symbols are in the executable and since the kernel
  can't handle shared libs it is meaningless.
