- Added __NX_CTypeTable_ and __NX_ULTable_ private externs
- Added docompare.csh, a shell script that will forcable run cmpshlib after
	the shlib is built, providing that there is a previous version of
	the shlib around.

For libsys-30 (Morris Meyer's mods)
- Added libbtree to Makefile
- Added software floating point (temporary).
- Added NXStringTable.o to spec_sys
- Added btree entry points to spec_sys and spec_sys_mdb

For the libsys-27 (Morris Meyer's mods)
- Added the overrides: target to the Makefile.  Any overridable object files
  that want to get added need to have a line in the file "overrides" that
  looks like:
  	.file_definition_libsys_s.B.shlib_OBJECT_FILE.o

For the libsys-26 (Kevin Enderby's modifications)
- Added the -seglinkedit and "-segprot __LINKEDIT rwx r" options to the mkshlib
  line in the Makefile.
- Removed the object gnulib3.o from libsys.  This includes removing a branch
  table slot for ___main and removing the undefined symbols ___CTOR_LIST__
  and ___DTOR_LIST__ from the spec_sys file, shlib.h and pointers.c .
- Added the following private externs for librld (cc-22 release):
	_pass1
	_delete_from_undefined_list
	_free_undefined_list
	_new_archive
	_clean_archives

For the libsys-24 (Kevin Enderby's modifications)
- Fixed the macros in shlib.h to have parameters so things like free will
  compile the objective-C project.
- Changed the Makefile to use libc/SHLIB_OBJS/IND_LIST from libc/IND_LIST.
- Added the librld stuff in cc-20 (cc-18.9 on land)
- Added the changes for objc-19
- Made the symbol catch_exception_raise overridable. It gets initialized for
  to object libc/shlib_objs/exc_server.o
- Fixed the #init's for ___CTOR_LIST__ and ___DTOR_LIST__ to only be done when
  libc/shlib_obj/gnulib3.o gets linked.
- Removed the #minor_version from the spec_sys file and added:
	-minor_version `vers_string -n`
  to the Makefile on the mkshlib line.
- Changed the spec_sys file to reflect the change of ownership from:
	libstreams/shlib_obj/except.o
  to the new owner:
	libobjc/shlib_obj/except.o

For the libsys-10
- Added the stuff to build libsys_p.a.
- Made exit(3) overrideable so it can be linked with gcrt0.o.
- Added the *_vers.o object from each of the projects to the spec_file.

For the libsys-3 (0.91) release (compiled with the cc-10 compiler):
- Updated to the new objective-C runtime.  Only the libobjc project has been
  changed (now objc-10 version).
- The links created for the lib<project> with the make installsrc now no
  longer have the project version on them.  There will be a symbolic link
  maintained for the project to the current version.
- Made one change to line 294 of libc/next/csu/gmon.c changing the asm()
  argument of "a" to "=a".  This will get it to compile with the cc-10 compiler
  but might be a bug in the compiler.

For the libsys-1 (0.83) release:
- Created libsys for the first time.  It includes libc, libm, libobjc, libsound,
  libstreams and libdb.  It replaces the shared version of all of those
  libraries.
