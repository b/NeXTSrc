	Changed occurrences of MNTTAB to NULL to force setmntent() to look in 
	"the standard place" instead of hard-coding a filename.

	Added support for "net" mounts. These mounts have characteristics
	similar to the automounter: directories are created as needed,
	symlinks are created if the host is local.

2-24-89 btaylor@NeXT.COM
	Fixed bug in above. "net" option should be removed once the
	path has been expanded (or you'll double expand it on 
	backgrounded mounts).
