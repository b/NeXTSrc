cmds-28
	Fixed vmmprint to work with latest kernel.

cmds-29
	Changed ps and mach_init to use new scheduler priorities.

cmds-30
	Fixed arp to use /mach, not /vmunix.
	Cleaned up Makefile for telnetd along with some conditionals
		(note, we should probably clean up all of the makefiles
		to no longer use -bsd or __STRICT_BSD__ and to not do the
		bogus cc -M hack with awk).
