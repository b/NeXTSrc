# If you do not plan to dial into your cube, then you can use the following
# settings.  You may delete those lines which have baudrates that your modem
# does not support.
#
# Note: For those modems that you may wish to use that uucp knows how to
# manipulate properly, you may use the ACU (automatic call unit) settings.
# Please read UUAIDS/L-devices.samples for a discussion on which modems are
# supported.

# Note: For those off beat modems that uucp does not know how to 
# manipulate directly. This means that a dialing script in L.sys will
# take care of the chore of dialing.

# For those who want to be able to dialin to their cubes as well as dialout,
# please consult the Digital Libraries for the wiring diagram for proper modem
# cable.  You may use the following settings provided that you have this special
# modem cable. Note that most modem cables which have a 25 pin D connector on
# one end and a 8 pin Mini-Din connector on the other DO NOT have the Carrier
# Detect line (pin 8 on the 25 pin D connect) connected to Clear To Send line
# (pin 2 on the 8 pin Mini-Din connector). This prevents the modem from being
# able to tell your Cube if the modem is busy or not. Therfore, for the
# following settings, you must insure you have this special modem cable.
