@# USERFILE:
# Lines are of form 'loginname,uucpname fileprefix[, ...]
# It is recommended that each site have a unique login name and password.
# fileprefix is typically / or  /usr/spool/uucppublic.
#
Unext,next /
#
# This last line is recommended to reduce aggravation.
# Security minded sites would probably use:
# , /usr/spool 
# instead of
# , /
