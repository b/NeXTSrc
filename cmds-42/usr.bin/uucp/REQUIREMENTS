The following files need changing in order to make uucp/tip/kermit more 'Turn-Key'.

1) Add to passwd and netinfo database. The password is "NeXTPoll".

Unext:H2spIt5egkfUA:4:4:Sample UUCP Polling account:/usr/spool/uucp:/usr/lib/uucp/uucico

	Risk:	LOW




2) Change the following line in /etc/sendmail/sendmail.cf to invoke a uucp poll
immediately after email is queued. This attempts to keep in line with the policy
of having things happen when the user expects them.

change line 259 of /etc/sendmail/sendmail.cf from:
	A=uux - -r $h!rmail ($u)
to:
	A=uux - $h!rmail ($u)

	Risk: LOW





3) Since these are expected to be single user machines, there is little reason
to protect the modem ports. This makes the installation of customer programs like
kermit easier and does not require that they run priviledged.

Change /dev/MAKEDEV:
/dev/MAKEDEV:60:	/usr/etc/mknod cua	c 11 192; chmod 600 cua ; chown uucp cua
/dev/MAKEDEV:61:	/usr/etc/mknod cub	c 11 193; chmod 600 cub ; chown uucp cub

Too:
/dev/MAKEDEV:60:	/usr/etc/mknod cua	c 11 192; chmod 666 cua ; chown uucp cua
/dev/MAKEDEV:61:	/usr/etc/mknod cub	c 11 193; chmod 666 cub ; chown uucp cub

	Risk: LOW
