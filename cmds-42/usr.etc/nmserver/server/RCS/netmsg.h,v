 * This file contains definitions of macros that will be used throughout the

 * here include a standard set of debugging macros, and others. 
 */

/*
 * HISTORY:
 * 14-Apr-87  Robert Sansom (rds) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *	Replace the tracing macros by including trace.h.
 *		N.B. trace.h is structured so that it can be used
 *		independently of the network server.
 *
 * 10-Mar-87  Daniel Julin (dpj) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added include of config.h. Replaced DEBUGOFF with NET_TRACE.
 *
 * 23-Dec-86  Robert Sansom (rds) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *	Made debugging variables be lower case.

/*
 * Function argument order is IN, INOUT, OUT, REF. These psuedo-keywords are
 * used to label the arguments. For example: 
 *
 * Char FunReturningChar(   IN arg1, arg2, INOUT arg3, OUT arg4, arg5, REF arg6) 
 *
 * IN    indicates arg value is read, and not written. All non-pointer arguments
 * will be IN. 
 *
 * INOUT indicates arg value may be both read and written. 
 *
 * OUT   indicates arg value is only written. INOUT and OUT apply to values
 * referenced by pointers. 
 *
 * REF   indicates arg is a pointer to shared data.  Data may be read or
 * written, but may not meaningfully be copied. 
 *
 * Note: 
 *
 * Functions for which all arguments are IN need not use any of these keywords.
