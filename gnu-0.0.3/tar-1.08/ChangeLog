Fri Jan 26 16:11:20 EST 1990	Jay Fenlason	(hack@wookumz)

	* diffarch.c (compare_chunk)  Include correct arguments in
	a call to fprintf() for an error msg.
	(compare_chunks, compare_dir)  First argument is a long, not an int.

	* tar.c (options)  Use tar variable (argv[0]) as the name to print
 	in an error msg, instead of a constant "tar".
	(confirm)  Use external variable char TTY_NAME[] for name of file
	to open for confirmation input.
	
	* buffer.c (new_volume)  Ditto.

	* port.c  Add declaration for TTY_NAME[].

	* rmt.h  Add long declarations for lseek() and __rmt_lseek();

Tue Jan 23 14:06:21 EST 1990	Jay Fenlason (hack@wookumz)
	* tar.c, create.c  Create the +newer-mtime option, which is like
	+newer, but only looks for files whose mtime is newer than the
	given date.

	* rtape_lib.c  Make *both* instances of signal-handler stuff use
	void (*foo)() on USG systems.

Thu Jan 11 14:03:45 EST 1990  Jay Fenlason  (hack@wookumz)

	* getdate.y  Parse European dates of the form YYMMDD.
	In ftime()  Init timezone by calling localtime(), and remember that
	timezone is in seconds, but we want timeb->timezone to be in minutes.
	This small patch from Joergen Haegg  (jh@aahas.se)

	* rtape_lib.c (__rmt_open)  Also look for /usr/bsd/rsh.
	Declare signal handler as returning void instead of int if USG is
	defined.

	* port.c Declare WANT_GETWD for SGI 4-D IRIS.

	* Makefile  Include defines for SGI 4D version.  There are a simple
	patch from Mike Muuss (mike@brl.mil).

	* buffer.c (fl_read)  Work properly on broken Ultrix systems where
	read() returns -1 with errno==ENOSPC on end of tape.  Correctly go
	on to the next volume if f_multivol.

	* list.c (list_archive,print_header)  Flush msg_file after printing
	messages.

	* port.c Delete unused references to alloca().
	Don't crash if malloc() returns zero in quote_copy_string.
	Flush stderr in msg() and msg_perror().

	* tar.c  Flush msg_file after printing confirmation msg.

Wed Jan 10 01:58:46 1990  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* tar.c (main): Change -help option and references to it to +help,
	and remove suggestion to run info (which is unreleased, so not
	likely to be of any help).

Tue Jan  9 16:16:00 EST 1990	Jay Fenlason  (hack @wookumz)

	* create.c (dump_file)  Close file descriptor if start_header()
	fails.
		(dump_file)  Change test for ./ ness to not think that
	.{any character} is a ./  These are both trivial changes from
	Piercarlo "Peter" Grandi  pcg%cs.aber.ac.uk@nsfnet-relay.ac.uk

	* diffarch.c (diff_init)  Print correct number of bytes in error
	message.

Tue Jan  9 03:19:49 1990  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile: Add comment at top noting that two source files also
	contain #defines that might need to be changed by hand.

	* create.c, diffarch.c, extract.c: Change L_SET to 0 in lseek
	calls, because only BSD defines it.
	* create.c (dump_file): Make sparse file checking code conditional
	on BSD42 because it uses st_blocks, which the other systems lack.

Tue Jan  2 13:35:56 EST 1990 Jay Fenlason (hack@gnu)

	* port.c (quote_copy_string)  Fix so it doesn't scramble memory if
	the last character is non-printable.  A trivial fix from Kian-Tat Lim
	(ktl@wag240.caltech.edu).

Tue Dec 19 11:19:37 1989  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon at pogo)

	* port.c [BSD42]: Define DOPRNT_MSG.
	tar.h [BSD42]: Do not prototype msg{,_perror}.

Fri Dec  8 11:02:47 EST 1989	Jay Fenlason (hack@gnu)

	* create.c (dump_file)  Remove typo in msg.

Fri Dec  1 19:26:47 1989  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at trix)

	* Makefile: Remove comments referring to certain systems lacking
	getopt, since it is now provided always and needed by all systems.

	* port.c: Remove copy of getopt.c, as it is now linked in
	separately to always get the current version.

	* tar.c: Rename +cat-tars option to +catenate or +concatenate, 
	and +local-filesystem to +one-file-system (preferred by rms
	and used in GNU cp for the same purpose).
	(describe): Reflect changes.

Tue Nov 28 04:28:26 1989  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* port.c: Move declaration of alloca into #else /* sparc */
	so it will compile on sparcs.

Mon Nov 27 15:17:08 1989  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* tar.c (options): Remove -version option (replaced by +version).
	(describe): Mention long options.

Sat Nov 25 04:25:23 1989  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* getoldopt.c (getoldopt): Make `opt_index' argument a pointer to
	an int, not char.

	* tar.c: Modify long options per rms's suggestions:
	Make preserve-permissions an alias for same-permissions.
	Make preserve-order an alias for same-order.
	Define preserve to mean both of those combined.
	Make old an alias for old-archive.
	Make portability an alias for old-archive, also.
	Rename sym-links to dereference.
	Rename gnudump to incremental.
	Rename filename to file.
	Make compare an alias for diff.  Leave diff but prefer compare.
	Rename blocking-factor to block-size.
	Rename chdir to directory.
	Make uncompress an alias for compress.
	Rename confirm to interactive.
	Make get an alias for extract.
	Rename volume-header to volume.

	Also make +version an alias for -version.

	(options): Shorten code that interprets long options by using
	the equivalent short options' code.  This also makes it tons
	easier to change the long options.

	(describe): Make usage message more internally consistent
	stylistically. 

Mon Nov 20 14:55:39 EST 1989	hack@ai.mit.edu

	* list.c (read_and)  Call check_exclude() to see if the files
	should be skipped on extract or list.

Thu Nov  9 18:59:32 1989  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* buffer.c (fl_read): Fix typos in error message
	"tar EOF not on block boundary".

Mon Oct 23 13:09:40 EDT 1989		(hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* tar.c (long_options[])  Add an option for blocked compression.

Thu Oct 19 13:38:16 EDT 1989		(hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* buffer.c (writeerror)  Print a more useful error msg.

Wed Sep 27 18:33:41 EDT 1989		(hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* tar.c (main)  Mention "tar -help" if the luser types a non-workable
	set of options.

Mon Sep 11 15:03:29 EDT 1989		(hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* tar.c (options)  Have -F correctly set info_script.

Tue Aug 29 12:58:06 EDT 1989		(hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile  Include ChangeLog in tar.tar and tar.tar.Z

Mon Aug 28 17:42:24 EDT 1989		(hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* tar.c (options) Made -F imply -M
	Also remind tar that the -f option takes an argument!

	* Modified -F option to make it do what (I think) it
	should.  e.g, if you say -F, tar won't send a msg to
	msg_file and wait for a <return> It'll just run the program
	it was given, and when the prog returns, the new tape had
	*better* be ready. . .

	* buffer.c (open_archive)  Give error message and abort if
	the luser didn't give an archive name.

Fri Aug 25 20:05:27 EDT 1989		Joy Kendall (jak at hobbes)

	* Added code to make a new option to run a specified script
	at the end of each tape in a multi-volume backup.  Changed:
	tar.c: made new switch, -F, and new long-named option,
	"info-script".  Code is where you would expect.
	tar.h: added flag f_run_script_at_end, and an extern char *
	called info_script, which optarg gets set to.
	buffer.c: line 1158 in new_volume(): if f_run_script_at_end
	is set, we give info_script to system(), otherwise we do
	what we've always done.  **FIXME** I'm not sure if that's all
	that has to be done here.
	
Thu Aug 24 10:09:38 EDT 1989		Joy Kendall (jak at spiff)
(These changes made over the course of 6/89 - 8/89)
	
	* diffarch.c: diff_archive: Added switches for LF_SPARSE in the
	case statements that needed it.  Also, skip any extended headers
	if we need to when we skip over a file.  (need to change
	the bit about, if the size doesn't agree AND the file is NOT
	sparse, then there's a discrepancy, because I added another
	field to the header which should be able to deal with the
	sizes)   If the file is sparse, call the added routine
	"diff_sparse_files" to compare.  Also added routine 
	"fill_in_sparse_array".

	* extract.c: extract_archive: added the switch LF_SPARSE
	to the case statement as needed, and code to treat the 
	sparse file.  At label "again_file", modified opening the
	file to see if we should have O_APPEND be one of the modes.
	Added code at label "extract_file" to call the new routine
 	"extract_sparse_file" when we have an LF_SPARSE flag.

	Note: really should erase the commented-out code in there,
	because it's confusing.

	* update.c: made sure that if a file needed to be "skipped" 
	over, it would check to see if the linkflag was sparse, and
	if so, would then make sure to skip over any "extended 
	headers" that might come after the header itself.  Do so by
	calling "skip_extended_headers".
	
	* create.c: create_archive: added code to detect a sparse
	file when in the long case statement.  Added ways to detect
	extended headers, and label "extend" (ack! should get rid of
	that, is atrocious).  Call the new routine "finish_sparse_file"
	if the linkflag is LF_SPARSE to write the info to the tape.
	Also added routines "init_sparsearray", "deal_with_sparse",
	"clear_buffer", "where_is_data", "zero_record", and 
	"find_new_file_size".
	
	* tar.h:  Added the #define's SPARSE_EXT_HDR and 
	SPARSE_IN_HDR.  Added the struct sparse and the struct
	sp_array.  Added the linkflag LF_SPARSE. Changed the tar
 	header in several ways:
		- added an array of struct sparse's SPARSE_IN_HDR long
		- added a char flag isextended
		- added a char string realsize to store the true
		size of a sparse file
	Added another choice to the union record called a
	struct extended_header, which is an array of 21 struct
	sparse's and a char isextended flag.  Added flag
	f_sparse_file to list of flags.
	
	* tar.c: added long-named options to make tar compatible with
	getopt_long, changed Makefile.
