#  The base name of the application goes here. This should also be the
#  same name as the SGS project the application is built under.

#  **2**  -SOURCE FILES-
#  Here list the .m, .c, .psw, .pswm, .s, .l, .lm, .y, .ym, and .ps files.
#  You may delete any lines that you don't use.  OTHER_SRCS is used for
#  files with other suffixes that you wish to be treated like source
#  (i.e., printed with the source, copied with the source, etc.).
#  For files in OTHER_SRCS, you need to specify the corresponding .o file
#  in OTHER_SRCS_OFILES.

#  These are passed as arguments to the Objective-C preprocessor, the C
#  compiler, linker, pswrap, the assembler, lex and yacc.  You may delete
#  any lines that you don't use.  All CFLAGS also get passed to
#  Objective-C and to the final link.  Under OBJCFLAGS, for each Objectice-C
#  library that you use that supplies class and message group files, you
#  must list a -I$(OBJDIR)/XXX, where XXX is the base name of the library.

#  Use the format "-lXXX", where XXX is the base name of the library
#  you want.  For example, to link with the appkit use "-lappkit".
#  DO NOT use absolute paths here.

#  has been installed.
