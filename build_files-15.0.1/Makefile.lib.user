#  **1**  -LIBRARY NAME-
#  The base name of the library goes here. This should also be the same
#  name as the SGS project the library is built under.  For example, if
#  you enter "appkit" as the name, then the name of the SGS project
#  should be "appkit", and the library created will be "libappkit.a".
NAME = 

#  **2**  -SOURCE FILES-
#  Here list the .m, .c, .psw, .pswm, .s, .l, .lm, .y, .ym, .ps and
#  .spec files.  You may delete any lines that you don't use.
#  OTHER_SRCS is used for files with other suffixes that you wish
#  to be treated like source (i.e., printed with the source, copied
#  with the source, etc.).  For files in OTHER_SRCS, you need to
#  specify the corresponding .o file in OTHER_SRCS_OFILES.

#  **3**  -COMMAND OPTIONS-
#  These are passed as arguments to the Objective-C preprocessor, the C
#  compiler, pswrap, the assembler, lex, yacc and speculate.  You may
#  delete lines that you don't use.  All CFLAGS also get passed to
#  Objective-C.
#  DEBUGCFLAGS is substituted for CFLAGS when "debug" is made.
#  PROFCFLAGS is substituted for CFLAGS when "profile" is made.
#  Under OBJCFLAGS, for each library that you use that supplies class
#  and message group files, you must use a -I$(OBJDIR)/XXX, where
#  XXX is the base name of the library.

#  **4**  -INCLUDE FILES-

#  by the library's users.  Public include files are needed by others who
#  will use the library, and must be installed along with the library.

#  **5**  -BY_PRODUCTS GENERATED FROM BUILDS-
#  If your build procedure creates any files other than .o files and the
#  .c and .m files left over from pswrap, you should list them here so
#  they are removed when a make clean is done.

#  **6**  -ALL AND INSTALL TARGETS-
#  You must define your ownb all and install targets here.  "all" should
#  build all products of your project.  "install" should install these
#  products in the filesystem whose root is $(DSTROOT).  There are certain
#  targets defined in Makefile.lib which you can use to fulfill the all
#  and install targets.  These are optimized, debug, profile,
#  optimized_install, debug_install, profile_install and common_install.
